# TLS Hello Dumper

This is a tool to count the TLS protocol versions and ciphers encountered by
your server (or client). It is written (read: shamelessly copied) in C for
maximum efficiency on a high-traffic servers.

This program is inspired by xnyhps' great

[posts](https://blog.thijsalkema.de/blog/2013/09/02/the-state-of-tls-on-xmpp-3/)
about the state of TLS on XMPP. It is based on example code by the Tcpdump
Group.

## Restrictions

This tool so far only supports IPv4, has a hacked-together TCP packet parser
and its configuration options are severely limited.

If you feed it bad packets, it will die a horrible death, open a reverse shell
or eat your babies.

Currently, the tool is creating two log entries for each new SSL/TLS
connection. This will bias your statistics towards clients with bad
connectivity, and against long-living connections. *This is not a replacement
for dumping the SSL/TLS ciphers from all open connections to your server.*

If you specify a network device, it will enter PROMISC mode. Use only
if you are authorized to sniff the network.

## Compilation

To compile, simply run `make`. Have a look at the Makefile to tune the output
parameters (`#define`s). Possible compile-time options:

 * `LOG_COUNTER` display a linear packet counter
 * `LOG_ADDRESSES` display IPs
 * `LOG_PORTS` display TCP ports
 * `LOG_SESSIONID` show if packets contain a session ID (it is not actually dumped)

## Usage

Run the tool as root, supply at least the network interface as a parameter:

	./tls-hello-dump eth0

You can add a filter as well:

	./tls-hello-dump eth0 xmpp
	./tls-hello-dump eth0 https
	./tls-hello-dump eth0 'tcp port 995 and tcp[32]=22 and (tcp[37]=1 or tcp[37]=2)'

(The cryptic filter part starting with `and` is needed to filter out TLS Hello
packets. Never forget to add it!)

## Parsing the output

This is an example of the program output:

	tls-hello-dumper - TLS ClientHello/ServerHello Dumper
	Copyright (c) 2013 Georg Lukas, based on Tcpdump code.
	THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY FOR THIS PROGRAM.

	Device: wlan0
	Filter expression: tcp port 443 and tcp[32]=22 and (tcp[37]=1 or tcp[37]=2)

	Source          Destination     Packet content
	192.168.23.42   83.223.75.24    TLSv1 ClientHello TLSv1.2 :C030:C02C:C028:C024:C014:C00A:C022:C021:00A3:009F:006B:006A:0039:0038:0088:0087:C032:C02E:C02A:C026:C00F:C005:009D:003D:0035:0084:C012:C008:C01C:C01B:0016:0013:C00D:C003:000A:C02F:C02B:C027:C023:C013:C009:C01F:C01E:00A2:009E:0067:0040:0033:0032:009A:0099:0045:0044:C031:C02D:C029:C025:C00E:C004:009C:003C:002F:0096:0041:C011:C007:C00C:C002:0005:0004:0015:0012:0009:0014:0011:0008:0006:0003:00FF:
	83.223.75.24    192.168.23.42   TLSv1 ServerHello TLSv1 cipher 0039

Depending on your compile-time options, you might see more or less columns.
The most interesting one is the last one, "Packet content". It starts with the
SSL/TLS protocol version of the packet, followed by either `ClientHello` or
`ServerHello`. Then comes the maximum SSL/TLS version supported by the sender.

A ClientHello contains the list of supported ciphers, in hexadecimal format.

A ServerHello contains the chosen cipher suite, in hex. This is what matters
for the connection.

Because hex is not very readable, you can convert the codes into their
Wireshark-equivalent names, by filtering the output with the following `sed`
command:

	./tls-hello-dump eth0 | sed -f ./readable.sed
	...
	83.223.75.24    192.168.23.42   TLSv1 ServerHello TLSv1 cipher TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
	...

**Beware:** The script will convert any uppercase two-byte hex numbers it
encounters into their equivalent cipher names.
